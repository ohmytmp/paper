    \par With the development of computer technology, great changes have taken place in the way and speed of people's access to information.In our daily life, computer users will face a large number of files, most of which are media files (such as images, audio, video, etc.).
    
    \par This paper designs a file classification and management software, and it will be open source. The software includes a core and plug-ins. The core includes a plug-in manager based on event-driven architecture. This software includes 17 plug-ins, which have the functions of file information viewing and management, similar and identical file retrieval, label prediction and management, file retrieval based on collection operation expression, file sorting and so on. Because this software is free software, combined with the theory and practical experience of software engineering, the iterative model is chosen as the development process model.

    \par Based on the logical sequence of software engineering, this paper describes the development process of the software. Among them, for the detailed design and implementation, it explains the principles of mathematics, cryptography, compilation, algorithm and other fields involved in the implementation process.
